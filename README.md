## On MongoDB üçÉ

When using Windows, an important part to understand handling MongoDB is how to include the MongoDB binaries to the environment variables.

The procedure is explained on the [installation guide](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/) but an interesting explanation on the legacy command 'mongo' is found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-d6VAYrjeQ) and was very useful in the development the project.

We create and populante the bookAPI database used on the project by doing `mongosh bookAPI booksJson.js`. To check it, we can enter `mongosh` and execute in the terminal

```bash
show dbs;
use bookAPI
```

After that, we have switched to the bookAPI, we can see the collections using `show collections` and display the contents of it using `db.books.find()`
